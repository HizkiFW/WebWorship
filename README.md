# Worshipweb (name pending)

Web-based lyrics display software.

Live deploy available on [Netlify](https://worshipweb.netlify.com/)

### Background

This project is maintained by **Hizkia Felix** and **Jonathan Filbert**. Originally we started this project as we have been searching for an alternative and more flexible lyric displaying software to be used in our local church.

We have tried some free and open source _church softwares_, but some are just too fragile and/or too bloated by unnecessary features.
We 👏 Just 👏 Want 👏 To 👏 Display 👏 Lyrics.

We then decided that softwares are not really our target product here, since there are a lot of people that have done so, So we picked an alternative approach in which we developed a **Web-app**, not just an ordinary web app, a **blazing-fast web-app** that's sole job is to display lyrics in a single browser page with a black background (_As the approach in our church is to layer this lyric afterwards to our Resolume visual layer_).
